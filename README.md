# hello-world
 
Hello everyone!

I'm new to GitHub. I'm hoping to learn lots from other new people and veterans alike. I'm hoping to refine my coding skills and learn how GitHub operates. I just finished my second college programming course, we learned Java. I'm also taking a Python course next fall. I'm super excited to learn and to see how people all write code differently. I hope we can all be friends!
